# ChatBot
## UR Services ChatBot

This is a Chat Bot project that I wrote during my free time to help me on Campus @University of Rochester, developed using the Rasa Language Understanding library and trained by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
Data is collected and processed in real-time using BeautifulSoup and LXML


**Current features (there will be more!!):**
- Ask for opening hours of dining halls on campus
- Ask for directions (currently just showing a map, hopefully I can implement pathfinding sometimes soon :( )
- Ask for coffee places on campus that are open
- Ask for weather
