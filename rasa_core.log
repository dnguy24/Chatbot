Added 'SpacyNLP' to component cache. Key 'SpacyNLP-en'.
From /Users/ducnguyen/python/ChatBot/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/training/saver.py:1266: checkpoint_exists (from tensorflow.python.training.checkpoint_management) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use standard file APIs to check for files with this prefix.
Restoring parameters from models/nlu/default/current/component_4_EmbeddingIntentClassifier.ckpt

From /Users/ducnguyen/python/ChatBot/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/resource_variable_ops.py:435: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
From /Users/ducnguyen/python/ChatBot/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/backend.py:4010: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
